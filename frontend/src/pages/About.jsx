            ABOUT ME !
          </h1>
          <p className="lg:w-full h-auto w-[95%] m-auto">
            Hello! I'm <span className="text-[#ffe72f]">Abhishek Roy</span>, a
            Computer Science student at Brainware University with a passion for
            Web Development & Photography. My journey in technology began when I
            saw a video on YouTube titled "How to Hack Your Girlfriend's Phone
            ðŸ˜Š." That was the first time I heard the term "coding." Intrigued, I
            searched for more concepts about coding on YouTube. Gradually, I
            started learning C, and my learning journey continues to this day.
            Now, I am a good Frontend Developer. I wrote my first line of code
            on my mobile phone using the C language.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Over the past 2 years, I have honed my skills in programming
            languages like Python, JavaScript, and C, as well as frameworks and
            tools such as React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and Git. I also have
            experience with databases such as MongoDB. I thrive in collaborative
            environments and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to
            learn and grow.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In addition to my technical endeavors, I have a passion for
            photography. Capturing moments through my lens allows me to see the
            world from different perspectives and fuels my creativity. This
            hobby complements my work in web development, as it helps me
            appreciate the nuances of visual aesthetics and composition.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            As I continue my journey in the tech industry, I am excited to take
            on new challenges, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and
            contribute to projects that make a positive impact. My goal is to
            continuously learn and grow, staying up-to-date with the latest
            advancements in technology and applying my skills to create
            innovative solutions.
